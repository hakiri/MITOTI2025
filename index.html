        <h4>The 1st International Workshop on Middleware for IT/OT Integration
            (MITOTI 2025) </h4>
        <p>
            IT/OT integration bridges the gap between Information Technology
            (IT) systems, which manage data and business processes, and
            Operational Technology (OT) systems, which control and monitor
            industrial operations. It is a foundational element to drive digital
            transformation across industries. This convergence enables real-time
            data sharing and collaboration between enterprise-level applications
            and physical machinery, leading to smarter decision-making, improved
            efficiency, enhanced productivity, greater operational transparency,
            and enhanced safety. Developing middleware for integrated solutions
            that bridge the digital and physical worlds unlocks the full
            potential of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and paves the
            way for smarter, more resilient operations. Despite challenges like
            legacy systems and differing priorities, successful IT/OT
            integration is a cornerstone of modern, data-driven industrial
            environments.

        </p>
        <p>
            The primary goal of this workshop is to address the challenges and
            present advanced and innovative algorithms, models, techniques,
            architectures, specifications, tools, and frameworks that bring
            diverse middleware technologies at the interaction of Information
            Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). Contributions
            addressing both theoretical and practical applications, including
            but not limited to, the following topics are sought for submission:

        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> - Recent developments and future perspective of middleware
                    for IT/OT integration.</li>
                <li> - Middleware for edge-cloud continuum.</li>
                <li> - Software as a Service (SaaS) for OT.</li>
                <li> - Serverless and Function-as-a-Service computing for OT.</li>
                <li> - Middleware framework for robotics, ROS, and human-robot Interactions.</li>
                <li> - Middleware for converged infrastructure and IoT environment.</li>
                <li> - Platforms and frameworks for constraint devices.</li>
                <li> - Orchestration of IoT devices.</li>
                <li> - Monitoring and resource management of constraint devices.</li>
                <li> - AI based techniques for IT/OT integration.</li>
                <li> - IT-OT security issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p> <strong> Format (Half Day)</strong><br />
            Since this is the first offering of such a workshop, we propose that
            the MITOTI'25 workshop be organized as a half day workshop. However,
            if we receive a higher number of submissions and expression of
            interest from the community, we will request an extension to a full
            day workshop. MITOTI'25 will comprise 1-2 keynote speeches followed
            by technical presentations. The workshop will end with a group
            discussion among the participants discussing future directions and
            topics of importance. Depending on the quality of the presentations
            and discussions, we may plan a special issue of a journal, such as
            at Elsevier Journal of Systems Architecture or IEEE Internet of
            Things.
        </p>
        <p>
